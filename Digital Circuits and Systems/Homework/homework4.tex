	The circuit is not a latch. When initialized, the ciruit will default to the following state:\\

	And cannot be changed:\\

	\item [\textbf{Problem 4}]\hspace{0pt}\\
	A latch can be created with the first gate the following way (the square gates represent the AND with an inverted input):\\
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{hw4-4a}

	The XOR with an inverted input cannot be made into a latch. It can only implement an inverter and, through that, an XOR and XNOR. These gates cannot be arranged to be equivalent to a NOR or a NAND gate. They cannot be made to pass in 3 states and block in 1 and, thus, cannot form a latch.
